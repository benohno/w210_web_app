This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or people that we do not manage. We are not responsible for the policies and practices of any third parties, and we do not control, operate, or endorse any information, products, or services that may be offered by third parties or accessible on or through the Services. We have provided supplemental notices below for residents of California and individuals located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (collectively “Europe” or “European”). We collect Personal Data about you from: We may collect the following types of Personal Data: WHOOP uses cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services, as well as to analyze trends, learn about our user base, and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s). Cookie Usage and Type. WHOOP uses the following Cookies: Online tracking opt-outs.There are a number of ways you can opt-out of certain interest-based advertising and other online tracking activities, which we have summarized below. Please note that some opt-out features are Cookie-based, meaning that when you use these opt-out features, an “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your computer or other device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertising from certain companies. If you delete your Cookies, use a different browser, or use a different device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Opting-out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads. It only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests. You may continue to see ads on and about the Service. We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand, and personalize our Services. We use Personal Data for the following purposes: Service delivery, including to: Research and development. We may create and use Aggregated Data, De-identified Data or other anonymous data from Personal Data we collect, including Wellness Data, for our business purpose, including to analyze the effectiveness of the Services, to improve and add features to the Services, and to analyze the general behavior and characteristics of users of the Services. We also use anonymous Wellness Data for research purposes to help us and our research partners answer important questions about human performance and create an even-better experience for our members by identifying cutting-edge insights and providing new content and product features. Marketing and advertising. We do not use personally identifiable Wellness Data for marketing or advertising purposes. We may use other Personal Data, such as data collected when you browse our website, to send you marketing messages or advertise the Services: Compliance and protection, including to: We may share your Personal Data with: Depending on your use of the Services, you may share Personal Data with: Access, update, or delete.

When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request a full deletion of your account and corresponding data by emailing support@whoop.com. You will be asked to complete a verification form in connection with such deletion request in order to ensure that you have the authority to delete your account. We may need to retain certain Personal Data in our records, as well as Aggregated Data or De-identified Data derived from or incorporating your Personal Data that does not identify you after you update or delete it.

If you believe that a child under 13, or 16 where applicable, may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at\\xa0privacy@whoop.com. We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the WHOOP website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Our contact information is as follows: Whoop, Inc.\\nAttn: Data Protection Officer\\n1325 Boylston Street, Suite 401\\nBoston, MA 02215\\nprivacy@whoop.com Our EU representative is: DP-Dock GmbH\\nWhoop, Inc.\\nBallindamm 39\\n20095 Hamburg Germany Our UK representative is: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd.\\nAttn: Whoop, Inc.\\n16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden,\\nLondon, WC2B\\n5AH, United Kingdom You may contact any one of the above representatives at: whoop@gdpr-rep.com Legal bases for processing. The “How We Use Personal Data” section above explains how we use your Personal Data. We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others but will depend on the type of Personal Data and the specific context in which we process it. However, the legal bases we typically rely on for each category of processing activity are set out below. We may use your Personal Data for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and where the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis. Retention. To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Data subject rights. You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including: For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email whoop@gdpr-rep.com or privacy@whoop.com. Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request. Processing of Personal Data in the United States. To provide the Services, we will process your Personal Data in the United States, where WHOOP is based. If such processing involves the transfer of Personal Data to the U.S. in a manner governed by European data protection law, the transfer will be performed pursuant to the applicable requirements of the law, such as standard contractual clauses, the individual’s consent, or other circumstances permitted by European data protection law. Privacy Shield Certification. WHOOP certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and use of Personal Data transferred from the EU to the U.S. For more information about the Privacy Shield Program, and to view our certification, please visit\\xa0www.privacyshield.gov. Although WHOOP no longer relies on the Privacy Shield Framework to facilitate cross-border data transfers, WHOOP remains committed to the Privacy Shield Principles of (1) notice, (2) consent, (3) accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose limitation, (6) access, and (7) recourse, enforcement, and liability with respect to all Personal Data received from within the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield before it was invalidated. The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any Third-Party processing Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Our compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Please contact us at\\xa0privacy@whoop.com\\xa0with any questions or concerns relating to our Privacy Shield Certification. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield-related complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, you may also resolve a Privacy Shield-related complaint through JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. You can visit\\xa0https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim\\xa0for more information or to file a complaint, at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means. If you have any questions about this section or our data practices generally, please contact us at privacy@whoop.com or using the contact information above. We use some specifically defined terms in our Privacy Policy and when we communicate about our Privacy Policy. We want to be clear on how the terms we use are defined to help you better understand our policies. Aggregated Data\\nCCPA\\nCookies\\nDe-Identified Data\\nGDPR\\nIP Address\\nPersonal Data\\nServices\\nThird Parties\\nWHOOP Strap\\nWHOOP, we, us, our\\nWellness Data Aggregated Data\\nAggregated Data is data that has undergone a process whereby raw data is gathered and expressed in a summary form for statistical analysis. Raw data can be aggregated over a given time period, across individuals, or both, to provide statistics such as average, minimum, maximum, sum, and count. After the data is aggregated analysis can be performed to gain insights about particular data sets. When data is aggregated across a number of individuals, the resulting aggregation is considered anonymized such that it is no longer Personal Data. See our Privacy Policy here for more information on how we use Aggregated Data. CCPA\\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, is a state law that provides California consumers with robust data privacy rights. These rights include the right to know, the right to delete, and the right to opt-out of “sale” of personal information that businesses collect, as well as additional protections for minors. A “sale” under the CCPA is defined as “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.” See our Privacy Policy here for more details on the information we may share with others. Cookies\\nCookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular user and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the user computer. This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and is therefore able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next. See our Privacy Policy here to learn about cookies and how they are used on our websites. De-Identified Data\\nDe-Identified Data is data where all the personally identifiable information has been removed, rendering the data anonymous by stripping out information that would allow an individual’s identity to be determined from the remaining data. Data is “de-identified” to protect the privacy and identity of individuals associated with the data. De-identified Data is no longer Personal Data. See our Privacy Policy\\xa0here\\xa0for more information on how we use De-identified Data. GDPR\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is a data privacy and security regulation under European law that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and United Kingdom (collectively, “Europe” or “European”). The GDPR provides data protection rights to European residents and applies to any organization that offers goods or services to individuals in Europe, even if that organization is not based in Europe. See our Privacy Policy here for more information on the data rights available to European residents. IP Address\\nAn IP Address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. It allows a system to be recognized by other systems connected via the internet protocol. An IP Address may be considered Personal Data and is at times used by advertisers to serve interest-based ads. See our Privacy Policy here for details on how we share Personal Data. Personal Data\\nPersonal Data is any data that identifies or relates to you as a particular individual, including information referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information” under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations. See our Privacy Policy here for an outline of the ways in which we use, collect, and share Personal Data. Services\\nServices means, collectively, our websites and mobile apps, any software embedded within the WHOOP Strap, and any features, content, or applications offered, from time to time, by WHOOP in connection therewith. Third Parties\\nThird Parties in the context of the relationship between WHOOP, WHOOP Members (our end users), and third parties are entities or businesses involved in an arrangement, contract, deal, or transaction but are not one of the principals (i.e., WHOOP or WHOOP Members). We use Third Parties to enable us to do business with our members, such as charging for transactions or storing data. Third Parties also include advertisers that serve interest-based ads to visitors to our website. See our Privacy Policy here for more information on the Third Parties that do business with WHOOP. WHOOP Strap\\nYour WHOOP Strap is a wearable sensor that, when used in connection with the Services, collects certain types of Personal Data. WHOOP, we, us, our\\nThe terms “WHOOP,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Whoop, Inc. and each of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Wellness Data\\nWellness Data is (a) data collected by your WHOOP Strap and sent to the WHOOP platform, including your heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep duration, respiratory rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation level, and data such as the type of activity you engage in and the duration of your physical activity; and (b) any additional information you chose to enter during the use of our Services, such as information about your health and wellness, including information collected from accounts, devices, or features that you link with your WHOOP account. See our Privacy Policy here for additional details on Wellness Data.
